                <h1>Condo remodel</h1>
                <p>
                  3 months ago Emily and I bought a condo in the Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle. It's on the second floor of a 4-story building with 18 units total. Although the unit was in pretty good shape overall, there were a lot of things that hadn't been updated since the building was built in 1985. We didn't like the thin, dark wood baseboards and the big mirrored wall in the dining room. The carpet was pretty old we didn't love the color of the hardwood floors. So over the last few months we've made quite a few changes. We hired a contractor to put in the carpet, but everything else was done ourselves, with the help of a few amazing friends.

                <h2>Project Highlights</h2>
                <h3>Floors</h3>
                <p>Instead of having the hardwood flooring abruptly end at both ends of the kitchen we wanted the floor the flow though the entire house, which meant tearing up the exiting hardwood in the kitchen and entryway. That turned out to be a much bigger project than I anticipated, especially in the kitchen where the existing floor ran under the kitchen cabinets. That meant renting a special saw that could cut the floor right at the base of the cabinets. After making the cuts we could replace the floor in the center while leaving the old floor underneath the cabinets. The old floor was also real hardwood, which means it's really heavy. So hauling all of that off was a bit more troublesome than I expected.

                  Once we tore out the existing carpet and hardwood, we discovered that the subfloor underneath those areas was not at the same level. So before we could lay down laminate flooring we had to put down plywood where the hardwood floor had been to raise it up about 3/8" and match the level of where the carpet was. In addition to that, there were several spots where the subfloor underneath the carpet was not very level, so we had to fill some spots will subfloor patch to get the entire floor as flat as possible.

                  After all of the floor prep was finished, laying the new floor went fairly quickly. We were able to finish the entire floor in 2 days over a weekend. We left the existing floor in both bathrooms and the laundry room.
