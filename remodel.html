                <p>
                  3 months ago Emily and I bought a condo in the Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle. It's on the second floor of a 4-story building with 18 units total. Although the unit was in pretty good shape overall, there were a lot of things that hadn't been updated since the building was built in 1985. We didn't like the thin, dark wood baseboards and the big mirrored wall in the dining room. The carpet was pretty old we didn't love the color of the hardwood floors. So over the last few months we've made quite a few changes.
